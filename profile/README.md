# BrowseOS/AWBrowse

AWBrowse is the browser that will be shipped with [AWFixerOS]

BrowseOS will be a combination of AWBrowse, our [Kernel] and a set of network privacy and security tools, because your operating system was never any more than a glorified bootloader for your browser, right?

BrowseOS will not run on any special hardware, it will be designed to run on the hardware that Windows left behind when Micorsoft decided to waste everyone who wanted to keep using windows 10.
