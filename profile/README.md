# BrowseOS/AWBrowse

AWBrowse is the browser that will be shipped with [AWFixerOS]

BrowseOS will be a combination of AWBrowse, our [Kernel] and a set of network privacy and security tools, because your operating system was never any more than a glorified bootloader for your browser, right?

BrowseOS will not run on any special hardware, it will be designed to run on the hardware that Windows left behind when Micorsoft decided to waste everyone who wanted to keep using windows 10.

This org only contains code specific to AWBrowse and BrowseOS, all of our central code is stored in the [AWFixerORG] GitHub Organization as it is also used by [AWFixerOS], [DevOS] and [Modded Android] as well as things like [DUtils], AJ Services and other things that are facilitated by [AWFixer and Friends] and their founders.
